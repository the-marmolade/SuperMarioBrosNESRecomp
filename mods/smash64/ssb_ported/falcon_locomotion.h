 * ==================== QUARANTINED — DO NOT PUBLISH ====================
 * Ported directly from VetriTheRetri/ssb-decomp-re @

 * See UNPUBLISHED.md in this directory.
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * This module is a faithful port of the locomotion subset mapped in
 * docs/falcon_movement_dependency.md. It works entirely in the SOURCE
 * GAME'S UNITS -- stick range +/-80, velocities in the source's world
 * units per frame -- and knows nothing about SMB1, the NES, or pixels.
 * The single world-scale conversion happens in game_smash64.c, at the
 * host boundary, exactly once.
 *
 * Everything the source got from its engine that we cannot reproduce is
 * excluded per the classification in that document, and the three forced
 * adaptations are marked ADAPTATION where they occur.
