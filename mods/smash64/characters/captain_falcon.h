 * direct port of an unlicensed decomp). This file only bridges it to the
 * engine's game-agnostic ForeignController ABI, which is why it stays
 * publishable while the port does not.
 *
 * Registered before main(); the mod package selects it by the plugin id below
 * when the Character dropdown resolves to "captain-falcon".
