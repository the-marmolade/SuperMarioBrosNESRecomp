/*
 * captain_falcon.c — Captain Falcon as a ForeignController.
 *
 * Deliberately thin. The state machine, physics and attributes are in
 * mods/smash64/ssb_ported/falcon_locomotion.c; this file only bridges them to
 * the engine's game-agnostic ABI. That split is what lets the bridge stay
 * publishable while the direct port stays quarantined.
 *
 * The SMB1 adapter (game_smash64.c) currently drives the ported module
 * directly, because it needs the module's own richer state to decide
 * ownership. This controller registration is what makes the character
 * selectable and gives the always-on trace ring its state names; when a
 * second game or a second fighter appears, the tick/resolve callbacks below
 * become the shared path.
