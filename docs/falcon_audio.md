# Captain Falcon audio

Captain Falcon's voice and move audio is derived on first play from the
launcher-verified owner ROM into the user's external integrity-checked cache.
No decoded sample, WAV, AIFF, ROM slice, or other SSB64-derived byte is linked
into the executable, committed, or shipped. Release activation preloads all
eleven clips and stays stock SMB if any one is unavailable or invalid.

## Source mapping

The primary implementation reference is JRickey's
[BattleShip](https://github.com/JRickey/BattleShip) PC port/decomp (local
checkout `4fc1128`). Its US data exposes the original route as
`gmFGMVoiceID -> fgm.ucd -> fgm.tbl -> ALBank -> decoded AIFF`. The earlier
`SmashBrosDecomp` checkout remains the local decoded-preview source only.

| Runtime cue | Source id / route | Local input |
|---|---|---|
| jump effort | voice 353, articulation 201, trigger 83 | `B1_sounds2/wave_083.aiff` |
| "Falcon" | voice 348, articulation 208, trigger 90 | `B1_sounds2/wave_090.aiff` |
| "Punch" | voice 347, articulation 209, trigger 91 | `B1_sounds2/wave_091.aiff` |
| Falcon Kick call | voice 346, articulation 210, trigger 92 | `B1_sounds2/wave_092.aiff` |
| Punch impact | FGM 184 -> 187 + fork 0; articulations 146/7; triggers 11/4 | `B1_sounds2/wave_011.aiff` + `wave_004.aiff` |
| Kick opening swing | FGM 41, articulation 173, trigger 18 | `B1_sounds2/wave_018.aiff` |
| Kick energy start | FGM 183 -> 186, articulation 147, trigger 11 | `B1_sounds2/wave_011.aiff` |
| Falcon Dive launch | FGM 182, articulation 41, trigger 18 | `B1_sounds2/wave_018.aiff` |
| Falcon Dive catch | FGM 19, articulation 463, trigger 11 | `B1_sounds2/wave_011.aiff` |
| Falcon Dive throw explosion | FGM 1 + fork 641, articulation 6, trigger 4 | `B1_sounds2/wave_004.aiff` |
| Falcon Dive throw voice | voice 338, articulation 213, trigger 95 | `B1_sounds2/wave_095.aiff` |

The four voice articulations and the Falcon energy articulations specify
approximately -1200 cents. BattleShip's `audio.c` configures a 32000 Hz
synthesizer, and the FGM path in `n_env.c` sends
`alCents2Ratio(unk2C + unk30)` directly to
`n_alSynStartVoiceParams`; an `ALWaveTable` carries no independent source-rate
field. The original byte stream is therefore consumed at an effective 16000
samples/second. The decomp preview AIFF's 44100 Hz header is export metadata,
not the game's playback clock. Local conversion assigns 16000 Hz before
resampling to the runner's 44100 Hz. The LightSwingL path combines +550 and
-400 cents, so its representative waveform is rendered at +150 cents against
the 32000 Hz synthesizer.

The FGM trigger operand indexes the 322-entry `B1_sounds2` sound array loaded
as BattleShip's first audio bank. It is not a `B1_sounds1` instrument index.
The previous extractor confused those namespaces and played
`B1_sounds1/wave_019` for both Falcon energy cues; that looped tonal sample was
the reported guitar-like tail.

The local extractor renders the move-specific subset of the FGM interpreter:
the 184 -> 187 Punch pitch sequence and its forked voice 0, the 183 -> 186 Kick
pitch/envelope sequence, FGM 41 LightSwingL, and Falcon Dive FGM 182, 19, and
1 including the explosion fork used by that route. It advances at BattleShip's
`184 / 32000`-second FGM tick and applies the decoded pitch/envelope/stop
commands needed by these programs. It is a focused offline renderer, not a
claim to implement every N64 audio opcode or the RSP mixer. The runtime still
receives ordinary bounded PCM one-shots; no FGM engine or ROM data is linked
into the executable. Voice samples and their pitch remain direct.

The release-facing reproducibility helper is:

```text
py -3 tools/owner_ssb64/build_final_cache.py --rom <owned-us-v1-rom>
```

It directly normalizes z64/v64/n64, verifies the canonical US v1.0 SHA-1,
decodes `B1_sounds2` VADPCM and the focused FGM routes, and atomically publishes
eleven mono signed-16 44100 Hz WAVs with the model runtime and final manifest.
It needs no FFmpeg or decomp checkout and refuses to write inside the source
tree. The four direct voice cues use deterministic 32-tap Kaiser-windowed sinc
resampling; their accepted duration is unchanged and measured error versus the
older FFmpeg previews is 0.21–0.26% RMS.

## Runtime cues

The community/decomp-derived state machine emits allocation-free, one-tick cue
ids through
`ForeignMoveResult.audio`. They match the source motion script:

- jump effort on the supported jump transition (the source uses this clip for
  JumpAerial; SMB1 has no double jump, so its one jump is the host adaptation);
- "Falcon" on Falcon Punch entry;
- "Punch" plus impact FGM on Punch frame 42;
- Kick voice plus LightSwingL on Falcon Kick entry;
- Kick energy-start FGM on Kick frame 12.
- Falcon Dive launch FGM on frame 13;
- Catch FGM on the first observable Catch tick;
- explosion FGM plus Captain's SpecialHi voice on Throw entry.

The SMB1 adapter resolves cue ids to optional clips. `mod_audio` copies each
registered clip, permits overlapping voice and FGM one-shots, saturating-adds
them into the APU's mono producer frame, and then lets the existing launcher
volume and clock-domain bridge process the combined stream. It does not open a
second SDL device.

The release plugin sets `NESRECOMP_SSB64_ASSETS` to the verified immutable
cache root. Developers can also set it explicitly. Set
`NESRECOMP_SMASH64_AUDIO_TRACE=1` to log each successfully queued cue for
scripted evidence; ordinary play does not log per cue.

Disabling the mod unregisters its clips. A save-state load stops all host-side
overlay cursors before restoring mod state: an already-consumed call cannot
continue or replay stale audio, while a future cue genuinely reached again on
the restored timeline fires normally.

## Evidence

- `tests/falcon_harness/audio.script` and `upb.script`: exact cue masks and
  one-frame timing;
  `mod_audio_test.c` covers registration, overlap saturation, stop, and
  unregister; the combined deterministic suite passes 14/14.
- `tests/falcon_m8_audio.script`: live jump, Punch, Kick, and Punch-windup
  save/load. With trace enabled, all seven mappings queue. The pre-save
  "Falcon" call occurs once; frame-42 "Punch" and impact each occur once on
  both continuations after the rewind.
- Final `RECOMP_AUDIO_DEBUG` capture
  `C:\temp\falcon_audio_battleship_16000_1556`: all seven cues queue at their
  expected frames. Reconstructing the first 500 bridge frames from `t1_apu`
  plus the registered clips, integer gains, overlap, and saturation matches
  `t2_bridge_in` exactly (367500/367500 samples). Corrected voice durations are
  0.218005 s (jump), 0.564014 s ("Falcon"), 0.938005 s ("Punch"), and
  0.829002 s (Kick).
- FGM route correction capture
  `C:\temp\falcon_audio_fgm_fix_20260809`: all seven corrected clips load and
  queue at the authored source frames. Reconstructing the complete 720-frame
  `t2_bridge_in` stream from `t1_apu`, cue chronology, regenerated clips,
  integer gains, save-load stop, overlap, and final saturation is sample-exact
  (529200/529200 samples). Correct FGM durations are 1.127778 s (Punch impact
  including fork 0), 0.810748 s (Kick energy start), and 0.187052 s
  (LightSwingL). `C:\temp\falcon_{punch,kick}_audio_spectrum_compare.png`
  contrasts the removed narrow tonal `B1_sounds1/wave_019` tail with the
  broadband authored `B1_sounds2` FGM routes.
- `tests/falcon_visual_upb_qa.script`: all four Falcon Dive clips load, launch,
  Catch, explosion, and voice queue at their BattleShip-derived frames, and a
  Catch-state save/load reproduces its image exactly. The source-routed local
  clip durations are 0.202834 s (launch), 0.149501 s (catch), 0.689252 s
  (explosion), and 0.695760 s (voice).
- `tests/falcon_tier4_mod_off.script`: holding B with the package disabled
  produces no Smash64 controller, asset, audio-load, or cue log.
- Temporarily withholding the ignored audio directory produces exactly one
  `local Falcon clips unavailable; continuing silently` message and a clean
  smoke-test exit.
