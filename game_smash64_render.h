/*
 * game_smash64_render.h — M6.1/M6.2 presentation glue for the Smash 64
 * player replacement mod.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from game_smash64.c (owned by the physics
 * workstream): this file only draws. It reads game_smash64_active() and
 * g_ram's screen-space player mirror bytes and writes nothing back into NES
 * state, RAM, or the physics/ownership machinery.
 *
 * M6.1/M6.2 established a hardcoded tracking cube. M6.3 loads the owner's
 * ignored Falcon runtime blob and draws the real skeletal model/animation;
 * the cube remains the graceful fallback when those local assets are absent.
 * Both paths are gated on game_smash64_active() and disappear the instant
 * SMB1 takes back a scripted sequence.
 *
 * Screen-to-world convention (there is no tile grid here, so this file's
 * camera and vertex data define what world space means -- see
 * voxel_renderer.h's mesh API doc):
 *   world X = screen column, i.e. the same coordinate space as OAM X and
 *             g_ram[0x03AD], offset by g_widescreen_left so the cube lands
 *             on the correct framebuffer column under widescreen too.
 *   world Y = height in pixels above the player's own foot row, positive
 *             up. Y = 0 is the screen row one past the OAM sprite's bottom
 *             edge (g_ram[0x03B8] + sprite height), matching the "foot" of
 *             the metasprite it replaces.
 *   world Z = model depth around 0; there is no host world geometry to align
 *             it with.
 * The camera remains perpendicular to the NES sprite plane for exact screen
 * registration. Falcon's authored model is rotated 90 degrees into a true
 * side profile, so facing changes read strictly left/right in this 2D game;
 * the placeholder cube retains a small yaw so it does not collapse flat.
 * Falcon is rendered into a 2x transparent surface and box-downsampled over
 * the native frame. This antialiases only his mesh while all NES pixels stay
 * untouched and sharp.

/* Register the OAM suppression predicate. Call once from game_on_init();
 * the predicate self-gates on game_smash64_active(), so registering it
 * early does not change behavior before the mod is enabled. */

 * game_smash64_active() is true; a no-op otherwise. */
