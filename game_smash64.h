/*
 * SMB1 host adapter for the Smash 64 player replacement mod.
 *
 * Answers "where is the player allowed to go" and owns everything the fighter
 * controllers must not see: NES RAM layout, SMB1's fixed-point velocity
 * representation, its scripted player states, and the one world-scale
 * conversion.
 *
 * Scope (M2 + M3): Falcon supplies horizontal velocity and vertical motion
 * (jump velocity, gravity, terminal velocity, fast fall, air drift). SMB1 still
 * decides when a jump starts and when a landing happens, and owns all
 * collision.
 *
 * See game_smash64.c for the Ghidra-confirmed addresses and
 * docs/smb1_player_adapter.md for the write log.
