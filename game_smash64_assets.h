 * Runtime-only selected Smash 64 fighter presentation.
 *
 * The loader consumes assets_ssb64/falcon_runtime.bin, which is generated
 * locally from the owner's ignored ROM extraction. No model, texture, or
 * animation bytes are compiled into the repository. The function returns 0
 * when the blob is absent or invalid so the caller can draw the cube fallback.
 * A voxel mesh session must already be active. output_scale converts the
 * native-pixel presentation size to the current render target (1 for native,
 * 2 for the Falcon-only supersample surface).
