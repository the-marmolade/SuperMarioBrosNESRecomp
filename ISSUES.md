# Super Mario Bros. — Known Issues

---

## ISSUE #1 — Black screen / CHR ROM zeroed at startup

**Status:** FIXED

**Root cause:** Two bugs combined:
1. `runtime_init()` called `memset(g_chr_ram, 0)` *after* `load_rom()` had already loaded
   the 8KB CHR ROM, destroying it.
2. SMB's RESET routine writes zeros to PPU address `$0000` (CHR space) as standard NES
   init. On hardware with CHR ROM this is a no-op, but our runtime wrote through to
   `g_chr_ram`, destroying it a second time.

**Fix:** Added `g_chr_is_rom` flag (set when `chr_banks > 0` in iNES header).
- `runtime_init()` skips `memset(g_chr_ram)` when `g_chr_is_rom` is set
- `ppu_write_reg($2007)` ignores writes to `$0000-$1FFF` when `g_chr_is_rom` is set

## ISSUE #2 — Background color black instead of blue

**Status:** FIXED

**Root cause:** NES PPU palette addresses `$3F10/$3F14/$3F18/$3F1C` physically mirror
`$3F00/$3F04/$3F08/$3F0C` (transparent/backdrop slots). SMB writes `$22` (blue) to
`$3F10`, which on real hardware also sets `$3F00`. Our runtime stored them separately,
so the universal background color stayed `$0F` (black).

**Fix:** In `ppu_write_reg` and `ppu_read_reg`, remap indices `$10/$14/$18/$1C` to
`$00/$04/$08/$0C` before accessing `g_ppu_pal[]`.

## ISSUE #3 — HUD flickers

**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED — major flicker eliminated, residual issues remain (see #8, #9)

### Symptom
The score/lives/coins HUD at the top of the screen flickered heavily during gameplay.

### Root cause
Three problems in the sprite-0 hit simulation combined to cause the flicker:

1. **Stale scroll at VBlank start.** The NMI handler writes `$2000` (PPUCTRL) early for
   the HUD nametable but does NOT write `$2005` (PPUSCROLL) until after the sprite-0
   wait. `g_ppuscroll_x/y` retained the previous frame's gameplay scroll, so when
   sprite-0 captured HUD values, it got gameplay scroll instead of (0,0).

2. **Counter contaminated by PPU upload reads.** The NMI handler reads `$2002` to reset
   the address latch before `$2006`/`$2007` writes (standard PPU upload pattern). Each
   read incremented `g_spr0_reads_ctr`, causing premature sprite-0 triggers during PPU
   uploads — before the game had written the correct PPUCTRL for the HUD.

3. **No fallback when counter missed.** If the counter-based sprite-0 sim failed to
   trigger, `g_spr0_split_active` stayed 0 and the entire screen rendered with gameplay
   scroll, making the HUD invisible.

### Fix (three changes in `runtime.c` + `ppu_renderer.c`)
- **VBlank reset:** Reset `g_ppuscroll_x/y` to 0 and pre-capture HUD scroll values as
  (0,0) in `maybe_trigger_vblank()` before calling NMI.
- **Counter reset on PPU write:** Reset `g_spr0_reads_ctr = 0` in `ppu_write_reg()` so
  that only consecutive `$2002` reads (genuine spin-wait polls) accumulate the counter.
- **Renderer fallback:** When `g_spr0_split_active == 0` but OAM sprite 0 is on-screen
  and rendering is enabled, apply the split using the pre-captured HUD values.

## ISSUE #4 — Enemy hit detection unreliable

**Status:** FIXED

### Symptom
- Jumping on Goombas did not kill them (stomp phased through)
- Walking into enemies did not reliably deal damage to Mario
- The auto-play demo diverged: Mario missed the mushroom power-up because the first
  Goomba wasn't killed, causing Mario to go too far right

### Root cause
The enemy state determination function at `$D969` was missing from the dispatch table.
This function is reached exclusively via cross-function branches (`BNE`/`BEQ` from
`$D8FD`, `$D90C`, `$D911`, etc. — approximately 50 call sites). No `JSR` or `JMP`
targets `$D969` directly, so the recompiler's function finder never discovered it.

When the generated code hit `call_by_address(0xD969)`, the dispatch table had no entry,
causing `nes_log_dispatch_miss()` and a silent no-op return. The function loads entity
state from `($16,X)` and compares against values `$12, $14, $08, $33, $0C, $05, $11,
$07` — this is the core enemy behavior state machine. Without it, enemies were
effectively frozen in their initial state and collision responses were never processed.

### Fix
Added `extra_func -1 D969` to `game.cfg`. This tells the recompiler to treat `$D969`
as a function entry point in the fixed bank. After regeneration, the dispatch table
includes the function and all ~50 cross-function branch call sites resolve correctly.

Verified: zero dispatch misses in 30-second gameplay runs. Auto-play demo now shows
Mario stomping the Goomba, collecting the mushroom power-up (Big Mario), and
progressing further through World 1-1.

## ISSUE #5 — Items don't spawn from ? blocks

**Status:** FIXED

### Symptom
Hitting a `?` block did not spawn a mushroom, coin, or other item.

### Root cause
`function_finder.c` inline_dispatch target bank tagging was wrong for NROM-256.
When scanning the fixed bank (bank 1), `switchable_bank == fixed_bank == 1`. The
old code:
```c
int dest_bank = (dest >= 0xC000) ? fixed_bank : switchable_bank;
```
Tagged all `$8000-$BFFF` inline_dispatch targets as bank 1, generating garbage
`func_XXXX_b1` functions decoded from the wrong ROM region. The entity state machine
runs in `$C000+` with `g_current_bank=1`, so `call_by_address(0xBC60)` dispatched to
the garbage `func_BC60_b1` instead of the correct `func_BC60_b0`.

### Fix
`function_finder.c`: changed inline_dispatch bank tagging to match regular JSR logic:
```c
if (dest >= 0xC000) {
    add_function(list, dest, fixed_bank);
} else if (switchable_bank != fixed_bank) {
    add_function(list, dest, switchable_bank);
} else {
    /* Fixed bank scanning switchable region: add for all switchable banks */
    for (int _b = 0; _b < fixed_bank; _b++)
        add_function(list, dest, _b);
}
```
Mushroom now spawns and rises from `?` block correctly (verified by screenshot).

## ISSUE #6 — Luigi unable to move (2-player mode) *(lowest priority)*

**Status:** OPEN (by design — controller 2 not wired)

### Symptom
When Mario dies and play switches to Luigi, Luigi cannot move.

### Cause
Controller 2 (`$4017`) always returns `$40` (no buttons pressed) in `runtime.c`.
SMB reads controller 2 for Luigi's input in 2-player alternating mode. This is not
a bug — controller 2 simply hasn't been implemented yet.

### Fix (when needed)
Add `g_controller2_buttons` with a second keyboard mapping (e.g. WASD + numpad)
and wire it into the `$4017` read path in `runtime.c`, mirroring the controller 1
strobe/shift logic.

## ISSUE #7 — World 1-2 causes random game over / warp pipe crash

**Status:** FIXED (resolved by earlier dispatch/function-finder fixes)

---

## ISSUE #8 — Residual HUD flicker / occasional missing HUD frame

**Status:** FIXED (four-part fix across three sessions)

### Symptom
Despite the three-part fix in Issue #3, the HUD still flickered during gameplay.
The flicker began once the screen started scrolling (e.g., when Mario hits the
first ? block in the demo and the camera follows) and persisted throughout.

### Root cause (final, after Ghidra investigation)
Four separate problems combined:

**1. Blank frames during screen transitions.**
SMB temporarily disables rendering (ppumask=$06) for 6-16 frames during nametable
loads. Our renderer painted the background color on those frames, visible as
flashes on LCD. CRT persistence makes them invisible on real hardware.

**2. Split-line seam artifact.** (See Issue #9.)

**3. Sprite-0 capture picked up gameplay nametable bits (PRIMARY CAUSE).**
The NMI's upload routine at `$8EA9` calls `FUN_8eed` (`STA $2000, STA $0778`)
which writes PPUCTRL with the **gameplay** nametable select bits (bit 0-1 from
`$0778`). This happens BEFORE the sprite-0 wait. When the counter-based sim
triggered, it captured `g_ppuctrl & 0x3B` — preserving nametable bits 0-1 from
the upload context. Once scrolling began, bit 0 alternated between 0 and 1 at
256-pixel boundaries, causing the HUD to render from the wrong nametable on
alternating scroll regions.

**4. Fallback split activated when game didn't want one.**
The renderer fallback condition `(spr0_y > 0 && spr0_y < 200)` triggered even
when `$0722` (ScrollFlag) was 0, meaning the game had skipped its sprite-0 wait
entirely. During mode transitions (title→gameplay, death, etc.), OAM[0].Y was
still on-screen from the previous frame, creating unwanted splits.

### Fix (four changes across `runtime.c` + `ppu_renderer.c`)
1. **Frame retention**: Skip rendering when ppumask bits 3-4 both clear; keep
   previous framebuffer content (CRT persistence emulation).
2. **Tile-aligned split_y**: `(spr0_y + 15) & ~7` for 8px tile boundary.
3. **Capture mask fix** (`runtime.c`): Changed sprite-0 counter capture from
   `g_ppuctrl & 0x3B` to `g_ppuctrl & 0x38` — clears nametable bits 0-1,
   forcing HUD to always use nametable 0. Matches VBlank pre-capture mask.
4. **ScrollFlag guard** (`ppu_renderer.c`): Fallback split only activates when
   `g_ram[0x0722]` (ScrollFlag) is non-zero, matching the NMI's own gate at
   `$8138: LDA $0722; BEQ skip_sprite0_wait`.

## ISSUE #9 — Title screen artifacts and split-line glitch

**Status:** FIXED

### Symptom
1. A horizontal line artifact (single scanline, wrong color/tile data) appears at the
   sprite-0 split boundary — visible as a thin line just below the HUD during gameplay
   and just below the HUD on the title screen
2. On the title screen, the top portion of the "SUPER MARIO BROS." brown curtain area
   shows a brief artifact/corruption that persists for several frames before clearing
3. A stray `?` block sprite appears on the right side of the title screen (it shouldn't
   be visible during the title screen)

### Root cause
**Split-line artifact:** The split boundary at `split_y = OAM[0].Y + 9` was not
tile-aligned. The renderer switched from HUD scroll to gameplay scroll at a non-tile
boundary, rendering a partial tile row with the wrong scroll source. The seam was
visible as a single scanline of wrong-colored pixels.

**Title screen artifacts (2 & 3):** These were caused by the same rendering-off
blank frame issue described in Issue #8 — during title-to-gameplay and gameplay-to-title
transitions, the game disables rendering for several frames while loading nametable data.
Our renderer was painting the background color during these frames, which was briefly
visible as a flash of stale/wrong content before the correct screen appeared. The frame
retention fix (Issue #8) resolved this.

### Fix (two changes in `ppu_renderer.c`)
1. **Tile-aligned split boundary:** Changed `split_y` from `spr0_y + 9` to
   `(spr0_y + 15) & ~7`. This rounds up to the next 8-pixel tile boundary, ensuring
   the HUD/gameplay boundary always lands on a tile row edge. For SMB (OAM[0].Y=24)
   this gives split_y=32 (4 tile rows), matching the actual 4-row HUD area.

2. **Frame retention when rendering disabled:** See Issue #8 fix — prevents
   blank frames during nametable loading transitions.

3. **PPUCTRL HUD mask cleanup:** Pre-capture mask changed from `g_ppuctrl & ~0x03`
   to `g_ppuctrl & 0x38` (only rendering-relevant bits 3-5). Counter-triggered
   capture mask changed from `g_ppuctrl` to `g_ppuctrl & 0x3B` (rendering bits
   0-1,3-5). This prevents stale VRAM increment (bit 2) and NMI enable (bit 7)
   values from affecting HUD rendering.

## ISSUE #10 — Demo sequence may be non-deterministic in real-time mode

**Status:** OPEN (needs further investigation)

### Symptom
User reported that the auto-play demo (title screen) sometimes plays out differently
between runs — Mario's actions vary (sometimes misses blocks, different momentum).
This was observed in interactive (non-turbo, real-time) play.

### Investigation results
**Turbo mode is deterministic.** Two scripted turbo-mode demo captures produced
pixel-identical results — same frame numbers, same NMI_dbg transitions, identical
screenshots at every 60-frame checkpoint.

**Non-turbo mode timing.** VBlank uses `clock()` in `maybe_trigger_vblank()` with
~16ms period. The main game loop (RESET handler at $8000) only polls `$2002` in a
tight wait loop — all game logic runs inside NMI. Theoretically this should be
deterministic since the number of poll iterations doesn't affect game state. However,
`clock()` on Windows has ~15ms granularity which could cause occasional double-fires
or skipped frames.

### SMB demo mechanism
SMB stores pre-recorded controller inputs in ROM at $D6FE+. The demo replays these
inputs frame-by-frame during OperMode=0 (title/demo). The demo is perfectly
deterministic on real hardware and in emulators. Any non-determinism in our recomp
must come from timing differences between frames.

### Possible causes
1. **Wall-clock jitter:** `clock()` granularity (~15ms) vs 16.67ms frame period
   means some frames may be ~15ms and others ~30ms, causing VBlank to fire at
   inconsistent intervals
2. **SDL event processing latency:** `SDL_PollEvent()` and `SDL_RenderPresent()`
   take variable time, affecting the `clock()` delta between VBlanks
3. **Audio queue backpressure:** `SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize()` check may cause
   variable callback duration

### Next steps
- Add `g_frame_count` delta logging to detect skipped/doubled frames
- Try replacing `clock()` with `QueryPerformanceCounter()` for microsecond timing
- Consider operation-counting VBlank model (count nes_read/nes_write calls) as
  an alternative to wall-clock timing for deterministic replay

## ISSUE #11 — Block-bounce / particle / sprite placement misbehavior

**Status:** FIXED — pre-existing recompiler bug (nesrecomp), NOT widescreen.
Root cause found via `--verify` oracle first-divergence; fix in
`recompiler/src/code_generator.c` (see Root cause & fix below)

### Symptoms (observed 2026-06-12 on the widescreen worktree build, 16:9)
1. **Falling brick on fresh load-in.** Entering 1-1 from the title, a brick sprite
   near the top-left of the screen falls top-to-bottom continuously, wrapping
   vertically and repeating quickly. It disappeared after the first Goomba stomp,
   but recurs on every fresh load into the level.
2. **Coin ?-block bounce broken.** Hitting a coin ?-block makes the block vanish
   entirely during the bounce, then reappear in its inactive (used) state. On one
   hit the bouncing block appeared momentarily at the far RIGHT edge of the screen
   — consistent with an 8-bit X wraparound in sprite placement.
3. **Mushroom ?-block particles misplaced.** Hitting a ?-block containing a
   mushroom spawns the brick-chunk particles far off to the left/right of where
   they should be, and the block that should appear inactive afterwards is
   invisible instead.
4. **Koopa sprite placement issues** (details not yet characterized).

### Classification evidence
- Reproduces in the **attract demo**, where the widescreen gate (OperMode 0)
  forces fully vanilla simulation AND presentation — widescreen code contributes
  nothing there.
- User reports similar misbehavior in **4:3 on Mac ARM** (no widescreen at all).
- Together these strongly suggest a pre-existing recomp/runner bug — plausibly in
  the OAM/sprite presentation path, which the `--verify` CPU-state oracle would
  not catch. A same-machine vanilla A/B run is still pending to confirm.

### If it does turn out widescreen-related (secondary suspect)
The OAM X16 sidecar uses a single global draw-context (true_rel/rel8 captured at
`$F179` GetObjRelativePosition). `RelativeBlockPosition` computes rel positions
for BOTH block slots back-to-back before any drawing, so the context for block
slot 0 is clobbered by slot 1; Misc (particle) objects have a similar shape. A
stale context that lands inside the delta window would bias sprite X wrongly.

### Root cause & fix (2026-06-12)

Vanilla A/B confirmed the bug with widescreen fully off (?-block shattered
like a brick instead of bumping to a used block). `--verify` oracle run over
the attract demo showed a persistent first divergence: `$0028 native=0x18
emu=0x00` plus `$0004-$0007 native=0x00` where the emulator had real pointer
values.

The recompiler's inline_dispatch emission (nesrecomp commit 09d5cbb)
hardcoded the trampoline side effects as `STX $27 / STY $28` — a pattern
adapted from **Gumshoe's** dispatcher. SMB's JumpEngine at `$8E04` does
nothing of the sort; it writes the pulled return address to `$04/$05`, the
dispatch target to `$06/$07`, and exits with `Y=2*A+2`, `A=target hi`.
In SMB's SprObject state layout `$27` is **Block_State[1]** and `$28` is
**Misc_State[0]**, so every JumpEngine dispatch (dozens per frame) stomped
the bounced-block object and the first Misc (brick chunk / coin particle)
slot:

- `$28 = 0x18` stuck → phantom Misc object simulated forever → the
  falling-brick-from-the-sky on level load
- `$27` stomped mid-bounce → coin-block bounce object vanishing /
  far-right X wrap / wrong shatter-vs-bump behavior
- particle misplacement and assorted sprite glitches (incl. koopa
  observations) from the same per-frame corruption

**Fix (nesrecomp `recompiler/src/code_generator.c`):** removed the
hardcoded writes; the codegen now **symbolically executes the trampoline
body** from ROM at codegen time (concrete per dispatch case: A = case
selector, pulled return address = JSR site + 2, table reads from ROM) and
emits the trampoline's true side effects — RAM stores, final registers,
flags, and exact cycle count (43, not the hardcoded 57) — per case. Any
unsupported construct fails the derivation loudly and emits no side
effects. Works for any game's trampoline shape (SMB JumpEngine, Gumshoe
STX/STY style, RTS-dispatch) with no game-specific constants.

**Verification:** `--verify` oracle over 8000 frames (title + full attract
demo loops): work-RAM divergence dropped from 100-400 bytes during demo
gameplay to a flat 22 bytes, all in the un-mirrored 6502 stack page
($01E9-$01FF, expected — SMB config doesn't enable push_all_jsr), plus a
1-frame verify-harness comparison skew at the title↔demo frame-counter
reset (5 of 8000 frames, recovers immediately). The demo now plays
byte-identical to the Nestopia oracle.

## ISSUE #12 — Widescreen: enemy spawn-timeline drift (DEFERRED by design)

**Status:** OPEN / DEFERRED — accepted trade-off of the widened spawn window;
user has okayed deferring (2026-06-12)

### Symptom
With widescreen margins active, enemies sometimes behave differently from
the vanilla timeline: different walk patterns on approach, enemies bumping
into each other, and occasionally an enemy visibly overlapping level
geometry (e.g. a 1-2 Goomba inside a brick column).

### Why this happens (mechanism, not a sim bug)
The simulation is oracle-verified vanilla; what changes is WHEN spawns
trigger.  Enemy placements are fixed world columns; vanilla spawns an
enemy when ScreenRight reaches its column, widescreen when the widened
right edge does — i.e. up to `right-margin` pixels of camera travel
EARLIER.  From that moment the enemy simulates normally, so by the time
the player arrives its phase (position along its walk/fall cycle) differs
from the vanilla timeline.  Vanilla also produces awkward spawn states
(enemies intersecting geometry they escape before scrolling into view) —
the margins simply make a region visible that vanilla guarantees you
never see, and the earlier spawn gives enemies more simulated time to
wander into odd places.

### Mitigation ideas if this is ever revisited
- Spawn at the vanilla edge but suppress drawing until the enemy has
  cleared geometry — rejected for now: reintroduces pop-in, the thing
  the widened window exists to prevent.
- Push the spawn window further right than the margin (extra hysteresis)
  so initial-state weirdness resolves before entering the visible margin;
  costs spawn latency for fast right-scrolling.
- Per-enemy-type policy (only screen-relative spawners like Cheep-Cheep /
  Bullet Bill / Hammer Bros timers really care about the edge).
