/*
 * game_smash64.c -- SMB1 host adapter for the Smash 64 player replacement mod.
 *
 * Answers "where is the player allowed to go" and owns everything the fighter
 * controller must not see: NES RAM layout, SMB1's fixed-point velocity
 * representation, and its scripted player states.
 *
 * SCOPE (M2 + M3): Falcon supplies the horizontal velocity AND the vertical
 * motion -- jump velocity, gravity, terminal velocity, fast fall and air drift.
 * SMB1 keeps everything else: it decides WHEN you jump and when you have landed,
 * it owns horizontal and vertical collision, and every scripted player sequence
 * stays native. See docs/smb1_player_adapter.md.
 *
 * Every address below was confirmed in Ghidra (nes/SuperMarioBrosNES) before
 * being read or written -- framework RULE 0 -- and the confirming instruction
 * is cited. Names come from symbols.sym, generated into the decls header.
 *
 * ONE FIGHTER. The fighter instance lives behind the ForeignController ABI, in
 * mods/smash64/characters/captain_falcon.c, and is driven only through
 * nes_foreign_tick/nes_foreign_resolve. An earlier version kept a private
 * FalconFighter here as well, which meant two independent Falcons: the private
 * one drove SMB1 while the registry's -- whose `grounded` nobody maintained --
 * fell forever and was what the trace ring recorded. The ring is the primary
 * observability tool, so a ring reporting a different fighter than the one
 * moving the player is worse than no ring. Do not reintroduce a second
 * instance.

 * the player. (Reporting the swept-actual rather than vanilla's intended

 * Horizontal COLLISION is not here -- DoPlayerSideCheck ($DD5E) runs inside

     * M4 step 2 -- walk the motion one pixel at a time against SMB1's own
     * tiles instead of teleporting the whole delta.
     *
     * WHY ONE PIXEL, AND WHY STOP *AT* THE BLOCKED POSITION RATHER THAN
     * BEFORE IT. SMB1 resolves its own vertical collisions, and both of its
     * checks are gated on how far INTO a metatile the player is:
     *
     *   DoFootCheck  ldy $04 / cpy #$05 / bcc LandPlyr   -- lands only when
     *                the coordinate's low nybble is < 5
     *   HeadChk      ldy $04 / cpy #$04 / bcc DoFootCheck -- bumps only when
     *                it is >= 4
     *
     * The adders (BlockBuffer_Y_Adder $E3D1) are +32 for the feet and +4 for
     * the head, so the feet cross into a new tile row exactly when
     * Y = 0 (mod 16) and the head when Y = 12 (mod 16). Those are precisely
     * the coordinates at which the two gates above fire. Stepping one pixel
     * and stopping on the first solid probe therefore parks the player on the
     * coordinate SMB1 is looking for -- the sweep FEEDS the game's own
     * collision rather than replacing it.
     *
     * Stopping one pixel SHORT instead would be worse than doing nothing: the
     * feet would never enter the floor tile, LandPlyr would never run, and the
     * player would hover a pixel above the ground forever.
     *
     * Only the leading edge is probed -- feet when descending, head when
     * rising -- because that is the edge SMB1 itself tests for that direction.

 * guest state. Nothing persists across frames.
 *
 * WHO ELSE SEES IT. Every reader of $000A was enumerated from the byte-exact
 * disassembly and cross-checked against a ROM-wide search for LDA $0A (8 hits,
 * 7 real + one inside E_UndergroundArea3 level data). Downstream of us in the

 *   $B47E CheckForJumping   the target.

 *                           frame, and what stops InitJS re-firing on the frame
 *                           after it while A is still held.
 *   $B37A JumpSwimSub       guarded by "ldy Player_Y_Speed / bpl DumpFall", so
 *                           only reached while rising. Falcon is grounded with
 *                           vy 0 for the whole squat, so it is not reached.
